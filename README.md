Obesity Detection Using Machine Learning 

This project focuses on the early detection of obesity using machine learning algorithms based on demographic and lifestyle data. Obesity is a major public health issue, and early identification can help in planning effective health interventions and improving long-term outcomes.

 Project Objective 

- Predict the obesity level of individuals based on their demographic and behavioral attributes  
- Apply and compare multiple machine learning algorithms for performance  
- Handle class imbalance issues to improve overall model effectiveness  
- Provide an efficient solution for personalized healthcare support  

 Dataset 

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- Features: Demographic, lifestyle, and physical metrics  
- Target: Obesity category  
- Class Imbalance: Addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
